This is the AR5212 HAL release by Atheros in 2008.

It was intended for use by the ath5k and madwifi development
efforts.

This github repository is the original HAL, untouched after
the original release.  It's intended as a historical reference
point.

The original notice follows:

Subject	Release of Atheros 802.11abg HAL under the ISC

As part of our commitment to help support all of our Atheros devices
under Linux we'd like to announce the release of our Atheros HAL for
our 802.11abg chipsets under the ISC license.

You can find it here:

http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mcgrof/legacy-hal.tar.bz2

This can be used as a source of documentation to help ath5k move
forward to support our 802.11abg chipsets as best as possible in
the Linux kernel. We look forward to keep working strongly with the
community on advancing support of all our Atheros chipsets under Linux.

  Luis
